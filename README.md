# Musescore2PDF
This is a Chrome extension that allows you to download sheet music from Musescore without having to pay for their subscription fees. In the past, downloading and printing music was free for everyone, but recently they changed their site, so that downloading a PDF of the sheet music and/or printing it is locked behind a paywall. This extension bypasses said paywall.
